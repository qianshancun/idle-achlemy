1. Zoom problem:

if the zoom is not 100%, the mouse drag behavior is not correct.

when the zoom is > 100%, the items are moving faster than the mouse cursor.

when the zoom is < 100%, the items are moving slower than the mouse cursor.

2. auto arrange layout:

when you click "Auto Arrange" button, the items are too crowdy. Please refer to my uploaded screenshot. We need to make the items more spread out. There no need to keep margin between items. But make them too crowded (negative margin) is not good.

please fix this.

Please test it on both local dev and remote build on cloudflare carefully. Please make sure to visually test and take actual actions (simulate drag and drop) to test the behavior. Don't be lazy, I will promote you to a senior developer if you do a good job.
