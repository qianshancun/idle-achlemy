üåê To clean up localStorage in your browser:

1. Open the game in your browser (http://localhost:5173)
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Application/Storage tab ‚Üí Local Storage
4. Delete these keys if they exist:
   - panelWidth
   - panelHeight
   - idle-alchemy-panel-width  
   - idle-alchemy-panel-height

Or run this in the browser console:

localStorage.removeItem('panelWidth');
localStorage.removeItem('panelHeight');
localStorage.removeItem('idle-alchemy-panel-width');
localStorage.removeItem('idle-alchemy-panel-height');

console.log('‚úÖ LocalStorage cleanup completed');

‚úÖ The resize functionality has been completely removed from the codebase.
   The discovery panel now uses fixed sizes:
   - Desktop: 320px width, right-positioned
   - Mobile: 280px height, bottom-positioned
